## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ralphevmanzano/catlibrary.git
    cd catlibrary
    ```

2. **Create a `secrets.properties` file:**

    In the root directory of the project, create a file named `secrets.properties` and add your API key received via email:

    ```properties
    CAT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

3. **Open the project in Android Studio:**

    Open Android Studio and select `Open an existing project`. Navigate to the cloned repository and open it.

4. **Build the project:**

    Sync the project with Gradle files and build the project to ensure all dependencies are downloaded.

## Architecture
The project follows **Clean Architecture** principles and implements **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** to ensure a well-structured, maintainable, and testable codebase. It also employs the **Repository Pattern** and **Use Cases** to manage data and business logic efficiently.  

1. **Data Layer** â†’ Retrieves data from **local (database) or remote (API) sources**. The **Repository** abstracts these sources and provides a single source of truth.  
2. **Domain Layer** â†’ Contains **Use Cases**, which encapsulate business logic and process data before passing it forward.  
3. **Presentation Layer (MVVM)** â†’ **ViewModels** interact with **Use Cases**, exposing data to the UI via **StateFlow/SharedFlow**.  

This structured approach enhances scalability, testability, and maintainability, reducing dependencies between layers. ðŸš€
